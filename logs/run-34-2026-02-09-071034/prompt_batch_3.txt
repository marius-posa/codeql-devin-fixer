### CQLF-R34-0003: py/log-injection (py/log-injection)
- Severity: HIGH (7.8)
- CWE: cwe-117
- Location(s): github_app/app.py:75
- Description: This log entry depends on a [user-provided value](1).
- Rule: Log Injection
- Guidance: # Log Injection
If unsanitized user input is written to a log entry, a malicious user may be able to forge new log entries.

Forgery can occur if a user provides some input with characters that are interpreted when the log output is displayed. If the log is displayed as a plain text file, then new line characters can be used by a malicious user to create the appearance of multiple log entries. If the log is displayed as HTML, then arbitrary HTML may be included to spoof log entries.

### CQLF-R34-0008: py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization (py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization)
- Severity: HIGH (7.8)
- CWE: cwe-20
- Location(s): scripts/orchestrator/cli.py:334
- Description: The string [github.com/](1) may be at an arbitrary position in the sanitized URL.
- Rule: Incomplete URL substring sanitization
- Guidance: # Incomplete URL substring sanitization
Sanitizing untrusted URLs is a common technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.

However, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.

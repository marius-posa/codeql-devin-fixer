Issues to fix:

### CQLF-R22-0001: js/clear-text-storage-of-sensitive-data (js/clear-text-storage-of-sensitive-data)
- Severity: HIGH (7.5)
- CWE: cwe-312, cwe-315, cwe-359
- Location(s): docs/static/api.js:15
- Description: This stores sensitive data returned by [an access to devinApiKey](1) as clear text.
- Rule: Clear text storage of sensitive information
- Guidance: # Clear text storage of sensitive information
Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an attacker who gains access to the storage. This is particularly important for cookies, which are stored on the machine of the end-user.


## Recommendation
Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. If possible, avoid placing sensitive information in cookies altogether. Instead, prefer storing, in the cookie, a key that can be used to look up the sensi

### CQLF-R22-0002: py/flask-debug (py/flask-debug)
- Severity: HIGH (7.5)
- CWE: cwe-215, cwe-489
- Location(s): telemetry/app.py:509
- Description: A Flask app appears to be run in debug mode. This may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code through the debugger.
- Rule: Flask app is run in debug mode
- Guidance: # Flask app is run in debug mode
Running a Flask application with debug mode enabled may allow an attacker to gain access through the Werkzeug debugger.


## Recommendation
Ensure that Flask applications that are run in a production environment have debugging disabled.


## Example
Running the following code starts a Flask webserver that has debugging enabled. By visiting `/crash`, it is possible to gain access to the debugger, and run arbitrary code through the interactive debugger.


```python

By visiting `/crash`, it is possible to gain access to the debugger, and run arbitrary code through the interactive debugger.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/crash')\ndef main():\n    raise Exception()\n\napp.run(debug=True)\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Flask Quickstart Documentation: [Debug Mode](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#debug-mode).\n* Werkzeug Documentation: [Debugging Applications](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.14/debug/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-215](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/215.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-489](https://cwe.mitre.org/d",

Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace en",
